# Rank bindings for Dual Galaxy on Exabox Slurm cluster
# Used with partition: wh_pod_8x16_2
# Example nodes: wh-glx-a05u02, wh-glx-a05u08
#
# This is a Big-Mesh (SPMD) configuration where both ranks share
# the same mesh_id but have different mesh_host_rank values.
# Both processes execute the same code in lockstep.

rank_bindings:
  - rank: 0
    mesh_id: 0

  - rank: 1

# IMPORTANT: Use absolute path for multi-host execution
# Update this path to match your exabox /data/<user>/tt-metal location
