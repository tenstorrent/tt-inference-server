- Focus on writting legible code
- Minimize new dependencies that are not in the Python 3.8 standard library and not already used in the project
- Do not provide verbose explainations, writting code that correctly meets the requirements is more important, UNLESS there is a bug found in the code. If there is a bug it should be explained and proposed fix should be explained.
