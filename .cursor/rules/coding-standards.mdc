- Focus on writting legible code, minimize the nesting of if statements and for loops, use functions and classes to do this.
- Minimize design usage of mutating runtime state, try to use static representations that can be determined at import time.
- Use pre-condition checks for class initialization where possible.
- Avoid functions with more than 8 arguements. Use dataclasses where many functions have similar arguements. Use classes with an object oriented approach when natural when handling state that doesn't make sense functionally.
- Minimize new dependencies that are not in the Python 3.8 standard library and not already used in the project.
- Do not provide verbose explainations, writting code that correctly meets the requirements is more important, UNLESS there is a bug found in the code. If there is a bug it should be explained and then a fix to the bug proposed.
- Use clear and professional names for all variables, functions, classes, and files.
- Python string formatting uses F-string style (f"{}") not C printf style ("%s")
