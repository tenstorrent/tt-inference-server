description: Always activate virtualenv before running pytest in tests
globs:
  - tests/**
alwaysApply: true

- source .venv/bin/activate to run pytest
- Ensure new functionality has test coverage that is meaningful and tests full components with minimal mocking only of external calls.
- Make sure to run tests via pytest to check for breaking changes
- If you find a bug in code that is being tested call it out, don't build tests around it
